ADD STYLE TO THE WEBSITE WITH CSS

Your Task
You have been asked by League Director, Tom Denton, to create on of two different looks for the website (chekout Email and files m1task2 and web resources task2). The look will be based on one of two sketches that Tom sent. The steps outlined in this Plan of Attack are one way to break down the creation of one look.

Hereâ€™s what you need to include in the website:

1 properly structured CSS styleshet
Correct links to the CSS from the HTML pages.
Note: CSS styles can be specified directly on HTML elements, at the front of an HTML file, and in a separate file. We'll focus on the third option because that's the best one for creating a consistent site-wide look and feel. That's why you'll be creating a separate file (CSS stylesheet).
