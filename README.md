## Your Task
You have been asked by League Director, Tom Denton, to add two pages to the website (checkout Email and files m1task3 and Web resources):

A Game Information Page for members to find out logistical information about each game.
A Rules & Policies Page for members to read about the rules of play and the policies that MDHL follows.
The steps given in this Plan of Attack outline one way to break down the creation of the Game Information Page and the Rules & Policies Page into small testable steps.

Hereâ€™s what you need to include in the web pages:

Tables to present the game information data that Tom provided in a nice tabular fashion.
TIP: As you develop each page, remember to:

1. Update your CSS stylesheet as needed for the list and table styles, as well as any other formatting needs for the page.

2. Validate the HTML and CSS by using the W3C HTML Validator and the W3C CSS Validator.

3. Test all changes in a browser to ensure everything still looks and functions correctly.
