ADD STYLE TO THE WEBSITE WITH CSS

Hello,
Thanks for the draft. The right content seems to be there, but 
we've got some additional thoughts on how things should look. 
One of our parents is a graphic designer. She took a look at the 
pages you sent, and came up with the two attached design 
alternatives.
We want you to decide which looks better. You can send me 
another zip file for the website with updates.
BTW, Iâ€™ve also attached additional images that are referenced in 
the two designs that she created.
Thanks,
Tom Denton
League Director
