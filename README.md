## Your Task

You have been asked by League Director, Tom Denton, to:
<ul>
<li>Add a Registration Page for members to register to play on a team.</li>
<li>Update the Game Information Page with maps to show the various game locations.</li>
</ul>

The steps given in this Plan of Attack are one way to break down the creation of the Registration Page and the updating of the Game Information Page.

Hereâ€™s what you need to do for these pages: 

<ul>
<li>Registration Page :
<ul>
<li>Create an HTML form that matches the Registration Form provided by Tom.</li>
<li>Create a testing page that displays the information entered on the Registration Form when the form's submit button is clicked.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Game Information Page:
<ul>
<li>Update the page to include maps for each of the game locations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

Both pages need to use valid HTML and CSS code.
